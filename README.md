# Automatic Segmentation of Brain Tumours in Flair, T1 weighted, T2 weighted, T1 weighted with contrast enhancements volumetric MRI scans of the brain using Time-Distributed 2D Convolutional Neural Networks placed in an U-Net architecture.

We design an unique way to train a U-Net on lower end Hardware. 

### What is a U-Net?
A **U-Net** is a CNN architecture designed by Ronneberger et al. ([link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf)) which is used to segment medical images.
